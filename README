FortLab

================================================================================
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FortLab (Fortran Laboratory) is a set of Fortran 2003/2008 modules integrated
into a single library.

================================================================================
Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FortLab is still in early development and some components have not been tested.

Comments, feedback, and pull request are warmly welcomed.

FortLab is designed as combined library; however, each module in the FortLab
project is managed as a seperate sub project with its own make files and
testing.

Some of the components of FortLab use Fortran 2003/2008 fatures which have not
yet become commonly adopted by Fortran compilers.  As a result each componet
module of FortLab is designed as its own library so that users that are using
a compiler than is not compatable with some of the features used by FortLab can
use the modules of FortLab which are comparable.  For example the Fort Arrange
library works while gfortran while the Fort String library does not.
