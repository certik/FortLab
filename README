FortLab

================================================================================
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FortLab (Fortran Laboratory) is a set of Fortran 2003/2008 modules integrated
into a single library.  
================================================================================

================================================================================
Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FortLab is still in early development and some components have not been tested.

Comments, feedback, and pull request are warmly welcomed.

FortLab is designed as combined library; however, each module in the FortLab
project is managed as a seperate sub project with its own make files and
testing.

Some of the components of FortLab use Fortran 2003/2008 fatures which have not
yet become commonly adopted by Fortran compilers.  As a result each componet
module of FortLab is designed as its own library so that users that are using
a compiler than is not compatable with some of the features used by FortLab can
use the modules of FortLab which are comparable.  For example the Fort Arrange
library works while gfortran while the Fort String library does not.

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A make file is provided to build a static library.  Simply then copy
lib/libFortLib.a to where you sore libraries and header/FortLib.m to where you
store module files.  Alternatively when running make set INCPATH to the path to
where you store mod files and LIBPATH to where you store libraries.

If you do not wish to generate a module set MAKELIB to any value of 01.  An 
object file will be found in obj of the name FortLab.o and a mod file will be
found in header of the name FortLab.mod.
